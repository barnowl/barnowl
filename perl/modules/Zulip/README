BarnOwl::Module::Zulip is a terminal client for the Zulip
(https://zulip.org/) chat system. Zulip is influenced heavily by
Zephyr and so BarnOwl is a pretty good match for it.


PREREQUISITES

- all the normal BarnOwl dependencies, including PAR and AnyEvent::HTTP

- URI::Encode


SETUP

You'll need to get your personal API key from Zulip. You can find this
on your "settings" page.

To use BarnOwl::Module::Zulip, create a file called "zulip" in
~/.owl. The contents of this file should be a JSON dictionary:

{ "user": <the email address you use to log into Zulip>,
  "apikey": <your personal API key>,
  "api_url": <the API URL root for your Zulip instance. Should look something like 'https://chat.zulip.org/api/v1'. MUST NOT have a trailing / right now>,
  "default_realm": <optionally, the domain name you expect most users on your realm to have usernames under. Convenience feature for letting you send personals with less typing>
}

If your Zulip instance uses HTTPS (as it should), it is optional (but *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*) to specify an additional set of options in the dictionary:

{ "user": <same as before>,
  ...
  "ssl": {
           "ca_file": <path to your system's list of trusted root SSL certificates. It's /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt on Ubuntu or Debian>
	  }
}

If your Zulip instance requires SSL client credentials, specify the
paths to the certificate and key as "cert_file" and "key_file",
respectively, under "ssl".


USAGE

When you start BarnOwl, you should run "zulip:login". Or put it at the
end of ~/.owl/startup.


FEATURES:

- sending and receiving zulip stream and personal messages (including
  with multiple recipients, mostly-functionally)

- listing, adding, and removing subscriptions

- minimal support for stream creation (if you try to sub to a stream
  that doesn't exist, it'll _probably_ create a new one with whatever
  your site's default settings are)

- full filter language support (message attributes are mostly the same
  as zephyr) including support for "punt" and mostly-functional
  smartfilter.

- support for displaying message edits (they show up as new messages
  with the correct stream/topic/sender with the new text and opcode
  EDIT)


MISSING/UNFINISHED FEATURES:

- backfilling from history (this will be hard. barnowl currently only
  supports appending to the msglist from perl, and I think the msglist
  is also an array, so that's potential badness)

- smartnarrow robustness (has been ported from C, but almost certainly
  still has weird corner cass)

- better handling of personals with multiple recipients (I think Alex
  implemented this, but more testing is never bad)

- syncing the curmsg pointer with the server

- sending presence more cleverly (right now it just sends a ping every
  minute regardless of how active you are)

- deleting messages is probably interestingly broken right now w/r/t
  the hash of zid -> barnowl message id. make it work.

- being able to view user presence (ala zlocate/aim buddy list/jabber
  roster/etc)

- being able to invite people to invite-only streams

- improved URL generation. We shouldn't have to warn people not to
  have a trailing / in their api_url setting.


FEATURES THAT SHOULD PROBABLY EXIST BUT THAT I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT
MUCH

- editing messages

- option to allow in-place update of edited messages instead of adding
  a new message

- being able to create a stream with options (e.g. invite-only) set

- being able to edit attributes of streams (zephyr doesn't have 'em,
  but zulip does)

- being able to delete streams

- being able to see a list of people subscribed to a given stream


FEATURES THAT WOULD BE HILARIOUS

- zcrypt support


OTHER DEVELOPMENT WORK:

- general robustness (e.g. if you try to zulip:login again after
  do_poll has given up (because the server went away and didn't come
  back in a reasonable time, it probably crashes hard.)

- code cleanup (kill globals with fire, refactor long functions,
  possibly break out some modules?)

- Probably break out AnyEvent::Zulip into a separate module that this
  just uses

- get this merged into barnowl mainline, especially now that it has an
  XS change (i.e. it's not just a drop-in PAR anymore)
