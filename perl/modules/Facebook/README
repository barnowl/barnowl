NAME
  Facebook.par - Facebook support for BarnOwl

DESCRIPTION
  The Facebook module implements Facebook support for BarnOwl.

SYNOPSIS
  (1) Create an empty file ~/.owl/facebook (you can use the command
  `touch ~/.owl/facebook`), in order to enable the module.

  (2) Run ":reload-module Facebook" inside BarnOwl.

  (3) Follow the instructions in the admin message.  BarnOwl will
  ask you to log in via an OAuth URL, and run ':facebook-auth'
  with the resulting URL.  It will then ask you to record the
  resulting access token in your ~/.owl/facebook file, so you do
  not have to login on subsequent BarnOwl sesions.

  This token is valid until you change your
  Facebook password or you revoke permissions for Barnowl at:
    http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications&app_id=235537266461636

  (4) Start receiving wall updates in Barnowl!
      You can post updates with the ":facebook" command.

POLLING
  Facebook.par polls for normal messages once a minute. To disable
  polling, you can unset the 'facebook:poll' variable in BarnOwl.

TODO
  * Polling Facebook is pretty slow (on order of a second or more),
    and blocks the entire BarnOwl interface.  We need to confront
    Perl's threading demon.
  * Need to detect if you have two friends with the same name and
    disambiguate if so.
  * No messaging support.
  * No auto-completion support.
  * No posting to an arbitrary user's wall.
  * See code comments for more work items!

TECHNICAL NOTES
  This module uses 100% undeprecated Facebook Graph API, and should be
  an interesting case study of how to implement a desktop application in
  the new Facebook world order.  In particular, we do not use the old
  infinite session keys trick described in
  <http://www.emcro.com/blog/2009/01/facebook-infinite-session-keys-no-more/>,
  instead, we use offline_access to get non-expiring tokens.

  If we decide to extend our permissions to include read_friendlists
  (for filtering) and rsvp_event (RSVP from BarnOwl), we will need
  to make sure the UI for upgrading is correct.
