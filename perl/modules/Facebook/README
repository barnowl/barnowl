NAME
  Facebook.par - Facebook support for BarnOwl

DESCRIPTION
  The Facebook module implements Facebook support for BarnOwl.

SYNOPSIS
  (1) Run ":reload-module Facebook" inside BarnOwl, if the module has
  not been loaded already.

  (2) Run ':facebook-auth'.  Follow the instructions in the admin
  message.  BarnOwl will ask you to log in via an OAuth URL, and run
  ':facebook-auth $URL' where $URL is the URL you were redirected to.

  This token will persist across BarnOwls until you change your
  Facebook password or you revoke permissions for BarnOwl at:
    http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications&app_id=235537266461636

  (3) Start receiving wall updates in BarnOwl!
  You can post updates with the ":facebook" command.

INFELICITIES
  * BarnOwl will not receive all comments for news feed items, only
    comments for items that were recently published.  There is not
    currently a way to see starks for conversations that you did not
    participate in, and the only way to see starks for conversations
    you did participate in are Facebook's email notifications.  (This
    is a deficiency of the Facebook API, see http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/show_bug.cgi?id=18594.)

  * By default, BarnOwl will not display posts from organizations (such
    as bands you have liked) or application invites.  This is a
    judgment of taste from the original author.  This is not currently
    configurable.

  * Users and applications that you have hidden via the Facebook
    web interface will show up in the BarnOwl stream.  (This appears to
    be a deficiency of the Facebook API, see
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6405364/facebook-api-access-hide-posts-from-settings).
    Users are encouraged to work around this by using traditional Zephyr
    filters.

  * We are missing support for some notable features, including
    messaging (Facebook has not publically released the API for this,
    though we could sign up for the whitelist), events (seeing
    unresponded to events requires a custom FQL query
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752967/facebook-api-only-returns-25-events-max),
    notifications (not supported in Graph API yet).

  * Apparently Facebook now has a 'music' post type. Handle it.

WISHLIST
  * Smarter name de-duplication (see Facebook/Handle.pm for details.)
  * URL minification.
  * Multiple accounts.  (Does anyone do this? I don't think so...)
  * Zephyr class mirroring.

POLLING
  Facebook.par polls for normal messages once a minute. To disable
  polling, you can unset the 'facebook:poll' variable in BarnOwl.
