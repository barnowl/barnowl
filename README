Notes:
-----
This project's perl/modules/ contains the lib directories from the
following CPAN modules:

AnyEvent::HTTP
Facebook::Graph

Some have been modified slightly for the needs of this project.

(Note that these are all available as Debian packages)
We plan to soon add targets to the Makefile to check for and install
these for you.

Net::DNS
Authen::SASL::Perl
IO::Socket::SSL
Digest::SHA
