Based on owl 2.1.11, by James Kretchmar (http://www.ktools.org)

Notes:
-----
This project's perl/modules/ contains the lib directories from the
following CPAN modules:

Net::Jabber
Net::XMPP
XML::Stream

They have been modified slightly for the needs of this project.

BarnOwl currently requires the following perl modules off of CPAN:

AnyEvent
Class::Accessor
Glib
PAR

(Note that these are all available as Debian packages)
We plan to soon add targets to the Makefile to check for and install
these for you.

The IRC module requires:

AnyEvent::IRC

The Jabber module requires:

Net::DNS
Authen::SASL::Perl
IO::Socket::SSL
Digest::SHA1

The Twitter module requires:

HTML::Entities
Net::Twitter::Lite

The WordWrap module requires:

Text::Autoformat
