BarnOwl - owl, with more ponies

Source is freely available from http://github.com/barnowl/barnowl/

Based on owl 2.1.11, by James Kretchmar (http://www.ktools.org)

Notes:
-----
This project's perl/lib/ contains the lib directories from the
following CPAN modules:

Net::Jabber
Net::XMPP
XML::Stream

They have been modified slightly for the needs of this project.

BarnOwl currently requires the following perl modules off of CPAN:

AnyEvent
PAR
Net::DNS
Authen::SASL::Perl
IO::Socket::SSL
Digest::SHA1

(Note that these are all available as Debian packages)
We plan to soon add targets to the Makefile to check for and install
these for you.

The IRC module requires:

AnyEvent::IRC
Class::Accessor

The WordWrap module requires:

Text::Autoformat
