* DOING A BARNOWL RELEASE
  - [ ] Send mail to barnowl-dev indicating that a release is
        happening soon, and soliciting any improvements that
        developers want included in the release.
  - [ ] Wait a while (a week or so, or more if necessary) for any
        pending patches to get in.
  - [ ] Prepare the -rc commit
   - [ ] Run ./scripts/add-changelog NEW-VERSION PREV-TAG..HEAD
   - [ ] Edit ChangeLog to combine and filter entries
   - [ ] Edit configure.ac to bump the version to 1.Nrc1
  - [ ] Commit with message 'BarnOwl 1.Nrc1'; don't push until after
        builds all succeed
  - [ ] Run scripts/do-release with -f (so it won't complain about
        missing changelog), makes a tarball
  - [ ] Do a locker build (See DOING A LOCKER BUILD)
  - [ ] Update configure.ac on master to bump the version to 1.(N+1)dev
  - [ ] Push git git:
   - [ ] The RC commit
   - [ ] The configure.ac change on master
   - [ ] A release-1.N branch pointing at the RC commit
  - [ ] Copy tarball into /mit/barnowl/web_scripts/dist
  - [ ] Send mail announcing the RC to barnowl-dev@mit.edu
  - [ ] Wait 1-2 weeks, collect any bug reports
  - [ ] Fix any reported bugs on master
  - [ ] Cherry-pick/backport appropriate fixes from master onto
        release-1.N
  - [ ] If there have been many or large bugfixes, repeat the process
        for barnowl 1.Nrc2

* DOING THE ACTUAL RELEASE
  - [ ] Update the changelog and configure.ac for barnowl 1.N
  - [ ] run ./scripts/do-release
  - [ ] Do the locker build
  - [ ] Push the release tag
  - [ ] Write up release notes
        (I usually use the previous release's email as a template)
  - [ ] Update the website
   - [ ] Add the line that `do-release` printed to the changelog on the home page
   - [ ] Add your release notes as /release-notes/1.N
  - [ ] Send the release notes to barnowl-users@mit.edu

* DOING A LOCKER BUILD
  - [ ] Copy the tarball to build@nelhage.com
  - [ ] ssh to build@nelhage.com and kinit
  - [ ] On build@nelhage.com, run barnowl-build-all TARBALL.
        This script does builds for all Debathena platforms using chroots
        on nelhage.com, and ssh's to Athena 9 machines to do the two
        Athena 9 builds.
  - [ ] Sanity-check the builds
   - [ ] Do cursory testing on debathena platforms and both athena9s.
   - [ ] chroots on nelhage.com also useful
  - [ ] Update symlinks with locker-update script;
        - locker-update [-b] [-n] VERSION
        - e.g. locker-update -b -n barnowl-1.6rc1
   - [ ] Use -b to update the barnowl-beta name
   - [ ] Use -n first for dry-run

* LOCKER LAYOUT
  - builds/barnowl-VERSION contains the arch-independent files by
    version
  - arch/SYSNAME/bin/barnowl-VERSION is the actual binary
  - arch/SYSNAME/bin/barnowl is a symlink to ../../common/bin/barnowl
    (wrapper script runs barnowl.real). .../barnowl.real is a symlink
    to the latest version.
  - zcrypt is also installed with a versioned name, but currently
    barnowl-N will not run zcrypt-N, so we can't change that interface
    at all.
