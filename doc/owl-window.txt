				==========

owl_window is intended to be a wrapper over ncurses WINDOW and PANEL
objects to abstract away much of the nastiness that is ncurses. It
provides redraw scheduling, and sane window moving and resizing.

-------------------
Hierarchy and types
-------------------

owl_window creates a hierarchy of window objects. The hierarchy
currently uses ncurses' built-in window hierarchy system with
subwins. This was easier to implement but has some caveats, detailed
later.

At the top level, we have the screen window which represents the
actual screen. The screen window is not usually interacted with
directly, but rather it is a handle to interface with the terminal as
if it were a normal window.

Underneath the screen, we have top-level windows, or panels. Panels
are normal WINDOWs (newwin) connected to a PANEL (from
libpanel). Panels may overlap freely and maintain a stacking
order. (For now, this stacking order is not exposed except for a
mechanism to move a panel to the top. This is not difficult to
otherwise correct otherwise.)

Under each panel is a tree of subwins. These are backed by ncurses
subwins. Because ncurses subwins simply share their parent windows'
buffer, we cannot provide as many nice guarantees about
ordering. Sibling subwins may not overlap, and parents must
(sometimes) take children position into account. More on this
later. This model is sufficient for BarnOwl's current purposes. Should
we need to, this may later be reworked. (Specifically, we'd want to
back everything by pads and build a compositing window manager.)

Each of these three types is temporarily stuffed into one type. We can
later do subtyping of sorts, but that will require more heavy use of
GObject.

As an example, here is the graph used by BarnOwl's current interface:

      	       	       	+==========+
     	      	      	|| screen ||
      	       	       	+==========+
                          /      \
                +-----------+   +--------+
                | mainpanel |   | popwin |
                +-----------+   +--------+
               /   /    |    \          \
         recwin sepwin msgwin typwin   viewwin


A window may be unlinked from its parent with a call to
owl_window_unlink. From then on, the object is still accessible, but
it will not do anything. If desired, we may add the ability to relink
a window in future. This behavior allows us to safely hold references
to windows, even after they have been "destroyed".

----------
Visibility
----------

Each window maintains state for whether or not the user has requested
it be visible. A user calls owl_window_show to flip the 'shown' bit on
a window and owl_window_show_all to do so recursively. Likewise,
owl_window_hide disables this bit. If a window and all its parents are
shown, then the user has requested this window be visible.

We say a window is realized if it has a corresponding on-screen
window. A window will only be realized if it is requested to be
shown. Furthermore, the window's parent must also be realized (unless
it is the screen). If a window is failed to be created for any reason
(most notably if its dimensions are zero), owl_window will cope and
consider it unrealized.

This realized/unrealized state fixes two nuisances with the old code:

     First, owl_window can safely manage all NULL windows. Interacting
     code needn't check to avoid segfaults; the owl_window is never
     NULL, and code requesting the WINDOW will never be called when
     NULL.

     Second, we have a consistent handle to a logical window, despite
     changes in the physical window. This is important for resizing
     windows. It is difficult to safely resize windows in ncurses. It
     is usually far easier to destroy everything and recreate it.

Note that this means owl_window will intentionally never expose the
underlying WINDOW except during appropriate events.

--------
Resizing
--------

Windows may be moved and resized with owl_window_move,
owl_window_resize, and owl_window_set_position. Internally, resizing
is very simple. We unrealize the window, set new position, and then
realize it at the new location. When a window changes size, it emits a
"resized" signal which windows may react to. It may actually possible
to optimize moves, but this has a slight nuisance with incorrect
begy/begx values which cursors currently rely on.

It is intended that top-level windows connect to this signal to change
themselves, while windows containing subwins connect to their own
signals to relayout their subwins. This is because top-level windows
may be sized independently, while sibling subwins should not
overlap. The signals are implemented currently with GObject signals.

---------
Redrawing
---------

Currently, users of widgets in BarnOwl must remember to call
owl_foo_redisplay when a widget needs to be redrawn. This is quite
annoying and an implementation detail that functions like
owl_editwin_insert_string should take care of. To allow widget
implementations to redraw themselves without calling an expensive
redisplay many times, owl_window_dirty flags a window as "dirty". The
framework will promise to redraw that window before the next doupdate,
while repeated owl_window_dirty calls remain cheap.

Windows currently redraw with a "redraw" GObject signal. This and the
resize signal, is somewhat awkward for the editwin which attaches to
and releases windows, as we must remember signal ids. However, if we
make widget objects (owl_editwin, owl_mainwin, etc.) also GObjects,
these signals will automatically detach. We may also consider a
different mechanism than continuously attaching/detaching
things. That's kinda weird anyway.

(We may want to replace it with a normal callback at some
point. Mostly using the GObject signals to play with them, and because
we'd likely get some form of automatic binding generation.)

----------------------
Known issues and notes
----------------------

- owl_window does not export the underlying WINDOW*. This is
  intentional. To safely resize windows, owl_window reserves the right
  to destroy/recreate the window whenever it feels like. We can add
  "window-realized"/"window-unrealized" signals if people really want
  though.

- This is currently using GObject. This buys us a lot of niceness, but
  it is adding a new library with full-blown (and somewhat
  overengineered) object system. It's very useful for prototyping, but
  if people want, it can be replaced. I think it's actually
  worthwhile, as most of the overengineering is explicitly designed
  for language bindings, something we could be better at.

- There is this really sketchy "three types in one" thing going on
  with the screen, panels, and subwins. I'd like to refactor that into
  some sort of subtyping, but that would ideally involve even more use
  of GObject.

- owl_mainwin is not very well ported and the windows do not have a
  very consistent implementation. This is a known problem that will be
  addressed in the next iteration. The current ports were done partly
  as experiments for conventions and mostly to get something working
  as soon as possible. Among things that should change is for the
  widgets to all use new/delete/pointers instead of
  init/cleanup/embed-in-struct.

- There is a generated GObject that emits signals for all variables
  and random other properties. It's currently not used much. It may be
  useful later, or not. I think there is some value in having change
  notifications for all our variables, although the initial port of
  the mainwin and sepbar turned out not to use it.

- The editwin and a few others are strange and keep track of signal
  ids. This is somewhat a side effect of us not using GObject
  everywhere; the signals can automatically disconnect in the right
  contexts if we do.

- The sepbar depends on a value computed while the mainwin is drawn,
  so we currently ensure the windows are created in the right order
  for the repaints to occur correctly. This is rather poor and should
  be refactored later.
