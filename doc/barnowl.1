.SH DESCRIPTION
.B BarnOwl
is a fully integrated tty based instant messaging client.  Currently
it supports AOL Instant Messenger, MIT Zephyr, and Jabber.  It is
curses-based, allows for emacs-style editing of outgoing messages and
uses perl as an extension and configuration language.  BarnOwl will
also run happily without a configuration file.

Once BarnOwl is started, typing 'h' will display a help screen.
Typing \':\' enters command mode, allowing the user to type a BarnOwl
command line.
