     putting off. util.c - a can we break here'' function based on perl's
     Text::WrapI18N - asedeno
   * Remove more bad hacks. - asedeno
   * Remove a debug message I accidentally left in. Remove
     the hours old check_utf8 hackery in favor of actually marking strings as
     UTF-8 from the C side. - asedeno

   * First pass at outbound zephyr -> iso-8859-1 sanitizing.
     Not that we can input anything other than ascii yet...
   * Fixing bug encountered when last field was not null-
     terminated. - asedeno
   * First pass at incoming zephyr -> UTF-8 sanitizing.
     This only operates on incoming data so far. We still need to clean outgoing
     data -- the plan is to attempt conversion to ISO-8859-1, and use that if it
     works. - asedeno
   * Reworked the fmtext format to use in-line formatting.  Characters used
     for formatting are part of Unicode Supplemental Private Area-B, or
     Plane 16.
   * include wchar.h
   * replace hand-rolled width detection with wcswidth.
   * pad with space if we end up halfway into a character at the start of a line.
   * UTF-8 - first pass
   * make owl_text_truncate_cols() and owl_fmtext_truncate_cols() understand character width.
     This may need more work. Some code duplication - see if we can refactor.

2.1.12pre
        Don't crash when sending/logging outgoing 
	   AIM message and not logged in [BZ 90]
	Don't crash when senging to someone not on AIM buddy list [BZ 94]
	   (patch from Alex Vandiver)
	
2.1.11
	Don't crash doing zlocate with bad tickets. [BZ 12]
	Metion the path for the owlconf in intro.txt [BZ 54]
	Print better error message if startup fails due to unreadable
	   .owlconf [BZ 57]
	In load-subs: Print an error message if the file is unreadable or
	  doesn't exist, UNLESS load-subs is called with no arguments.  In
	  that case only print an error if the file exists but isn't
	  readable.  Still prints an error either way if zephyr reports a
	  failure. [BZ 19]
	Fixed some small memory leaks in logging if files unwriteable
	If the variable logfilter is set it names a filter.  Any messages
	  matching this filter are logged.  This is an independent
	  mechanism from the other logging variables.  If you want to
	  control all logging with logfilter the other variables must be
	  set to their default (off) settings. [BZ 37]
	Relatively substantial changes made under the hood to support
	  filter logging.  Now have more consistent interfaces to
	  creating messages etc.  Still needs more work though.
	Deal gracefully with being resized as small as 1x1 [BZ 3]

2.1.10
	Fix a new problem finding libdes425
	Don't crash on very long hostnames [BZ 52]
	In 'sub' command, create .zephyr.subs if it doesn't exist [BZ 15]
	A fix for certain resize crashes (partly from alexmv) [BZ 55]
	Turn off ISTRIP (gildea)
	
2.1.9
	Include /usr/include/kerberosIV if it's found
	
2.1.8
	Do OLC formatting for anything coming from olc.matisse
	Improvements to popup size algorithm (from gildea)
	Improved 'show colors' with non-colored labels
	
2.1.7
	The colorclass command is added, to make colorization easy
	Handle MIT Athena OLC zephyrs correctly
	Updated ktools website / bug address
	Do ntohs() when printing zephyr port in zephyr info
	Updated man page
	
2.1.6
        Fixed three bugs found by Valgrind.
        Fixed a case where doing "aim addbuddy" instead of "addbuddy aim"
	  would cause a segfault.
	pexec will now incrimentally display data as it is output
	  by the child process.  Additionally, commands running under
	  pexec may now be killed by quitting out of the popless window.
	Added muxevents select loop dispatcher.  File descriptors may
	  be registered with muxevents and handlers will be dispatched
	  to when data is available for non-blocking read/write/except.
	Switched the stderr_redir stuff to use muxevents.
	Print C-\ correctly (from gildea)
	Dropped first brace in muxevents functions for consistency
	Catch SIGHUP and SIGTERM and do a proper logout
	
2.1.5
	Added a licence
	The 'personalbell' variable can now be set to 'on' 'off' or
	  the name of a filter to match against
	The 'loglogins' variable now controls whether login/logout
	  messages are logged.  It is off by default.  For now this
	  affects only AIM messages, later zephyr login/logout messages
	  will also be logged if this is set to 'on'
	Added 'show license'
	
2.1.4
	Normalize and downcase AIM names for logging
	Fixed a bug where sending a null zsig could cause a crash
	Better 'away' toggling if only one protocol is away.

2.1.3
	Added perl filter elements.  Similar to having "filter <subfilter>"
	  in a filter, you may also have "perl <functionname>"
	  where <functionname> is passed an owl::Message object and
	  returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the message matches
	  that element of the filter.
	Don't print an error about loading subs if there is no
	  .zephyr.subs
	Do the initial zephyr_buddy_check when pseduologin set to true.
	Updated man page
	
2.1.2
	removed unused filter_depth variable
	Fixed memory bug on receiving pings
	
2.1.1
	Filters of filters now work.
	Removed the "possibly not readable" part of the config parsing
  	  error
	In the sepbar, reverse video the view name when it's not set to
	  view_home (as opposed to the static 'all').
	The '!' key (bound to 'view -r') now creates a negative version of
	  the current view and switches to it.  i.e. "show me all the
	  messages that are not these"
	Added the 'ignorelogins' variable
	Log when outgoing personal message fails
	Removed file descriptor from sigpipe catcher printer just for now,
	  since the field does not exist on OSX
	Added an ifndef for socklen_t in libfaim/ft.c
	Added the 'aim search' command.  The popup on callback may be
	  dangerous, should switch to an admin msg for results, or add a
	  new event queue
	First pass at AIM away messages.  It is a little different from
	  what most clients seem to do, in that an away reply is sent for
	  each message received.  Most clients only reply to the first one
	  per away-session.
	Now have a set of 'aaway' commands and variables just like the
	  'zaway' ones (except that changing the 'aaway' variable talks to
	  the server)
	The new 'away' command does everything for both AIM *and* zephyr.
	  There is a known funkiness here, where if you turn one away on,
	  and then use 'away' (or 'A') to toggle, you will turn on off and
	  the other on.  Just leaving it for now.  Should do better in the
	  next patch.
	The 'A' key is bound to 'away'
	Status bar can now read AWAY, Z-AWAY or A-AWAY.
	Changed C-n to scroll down just a line in popless
	If the config exists but is not readable, print an error before
	  exiting
	Only print forced AIM logout message once.
	Don't bind F1 to help in edit context
	Fix bug in 'getsubs' with no tickets
	New code for getting users from .anyfile
	Added the 'pseudologins' variable, and code to do it
	new attributes 'pseudo' 'logintty' and 'loginhost'
	Don't print extra new lines in popless_file
	New zephyr_get_field function
	
2.0.14
	Fixed missing word in startup message
	Better 'status' command
	Use '+' for popwin corners when 'fancylines' is off
	Allow TERMINFO to be overridden in the envrionment
	Command line arg -D turns on debugging and deletes previous
	  debugging file
	Do ~ expansion in 'dump' command.
	Current directory added to 'status' command
	Massive changes to libfaim and aim
	
2.0.13
	Changed startup message for new mailing list
	blist now prints AIM info even if .anyone is unreadable
	Catch SIGPIPE and print an error rather than crashing.
	        [It's possible that this may have some portability 
		issues under Solaris and we may need to add some

	Handle the case in aim_bstream_send where aim_send returns -1,
	        although there is likely an underlying problem here

	owl.c: don't call use_default_colors if we don't have it
	readconfig.c: added *commented out* code to try to find a
	  system-default owlconf if the user doesn't have one.  Have to
	  ponder if I want this
	zcrypt.c: don't prototype des_ecb_encrypt if there is a prototype in

	     time we visited that view.

	Fixed functions to handle curmsg being past the end of the view.

1.2.1
        New framework for command handling.

        Added additional options to delete command.
        The reply command now takes arguments.
        Added 'edit:insert-text' command.
        Added 'show zpunts' to show active punt filters.
        Added 'show variable <name>' and 'show variables'.
        Added 'show command <name>' and 'show commands'.
        Added 'show keymap <name>' and 'show keymaps'.
        Added 'M-u' to undelete all messages in current view.
        Fixed dotsend so that the zephyr will still send if there
             is whitespace after the dot but not on the same line.
             This should resolve an issue where dotsend wouldn't work
             if you'd gone up and edited a zephyr.
	Bug in page down fixed
	C-t will transpose characters
        Fix the scrolling bug where we would sometimes fail to scroll

        Refixed 'login or login' typo in help
        Fixed M-u description
        Removed 'first' and 'last' from basic command help

        Added "reply zaway" which sends a zaway response to the current msg.
        Added "edit:delete-prev-word" command and bound M-BACKSPACE to it.
	Some buffer overruns fixed
        Variables now have a summary and a long description.
                Only the summary is shown with help.
                The long description is shown with "show variable foo".
        Added a 'scrollmode' variable which determines how the screen
             will scroll as the cursor moves.  The default behaves
             identically to previous versions of owl.
             The following modes are supported:
             normal      - This is the owl default.  Scrolling happens
                           when it needs to, and an attempt is made to
                           keep the current message roughly near
                           the middle of the screen.  (default)
             top         - The current message will always be the
                           the top message displayed.
             neartop     - The current message will be one down
                           from the top message displayed,
                           where possible.
             center      - An attempt is made to keep the current
                           message near the center of the screen.
             paged       - The top message displayed only changes
                           when user moves the cursor to the top
                           or bottom of the screen.  When it moves,
                           the screen will be paged up or down and
                           the cursor will be near the top or
                           the bottom.
             pagedcenter - The top message displayed only changes
                           when user moves the cursor to the top
                           or bottom of the screen.  When it moves,
                           the screen will be paged up or down and
                           the cursor will be near the center.
        Added owl_sprintf which returns the formatted string, or NULL.
                The caller must free this string.
                This will allocate enough memory and thus 
                avoid potential some buffer overrun situations.
        Simple implementation of 'zwrite -m' (doesn't yet log an outgoing
                message as having been sent.)
        The "Not logged in or subscribing to messages" error 
                now includes the name of the recipient.
        The "disable-ctrl-d" variable may also be set to "middle"
                which will result in ctrl-d only sending at the 
                end of the message.  This is now the default.
                This also added a command "editmulti:done-or-delete".
        Fixed a bug in the "reply -e" command.
        Always clear the command buffer before executing the command.
                (So that interactive commands can sanely do start-command.)
        Fixed preservation of e->dotsend across owl_editwin_clear().
        Added history for multiline edit windows (eg, for zephyr composition).
                The M-n and M-p keys will cycle through the history ring.
                In particular, it is now possible to edit the command line
                of a zephyr being composed:  C-c it and restart it 
                and then M-p to get the aborted composition back.
        Added owl::send_zwrite(command, message) to the perl glue
                to allow for the direct sending of multi-line messages.
                For example:  owl::send_zwrite("-c foo -i bar", "hello"); 
        Changed owl_fmtext_print_plain to return an alloc'd string to 
                avoid buffer overrun risks.
        Added owl::ztext_stylestrip("...") function to perlglue 
                 which returns the ztext with formatting stripped out.
        Added colorztext variable which can be used to disable @color()
                 strings arriving in messages after it is set.
                 (Currently, changing its value won't reformat messages).
        Outgoing zephyr logging now obeys the logpath variable.
        The '~' character in logpath and classlogpath now gets
                 replaced with the user's home directory.
        Added simple implementation of smartnarrow-to-admin that
                 creates a "type-admin" autofilter.
                 This was done mostly so that M-C-n and M-C-p do something
                 sane on admin messages.
        Added opera to the allowed options to the webbrowser variable.
        Fixed some buffer overruns in the "reply" command.
        When repying to "all" on a message that begins with "CC:" (eg, sent 
                 with "zwrite -C", the reply line will be constructed
                 from the sender and the usernames on the CC: line
                 of the message being replied to.
        There is no such thing as C-R, so left C-r as it is but added:
                 M-r --- edit reply to all
                 M-R --- edit reply to sender
        Added RCS Id strings to all files.
        'show keymaps' shows details of all keymaps after summary list.
        Added --no-move option to delete command.
                In particular, delete-and-always-move-down may now
                be implemented with 
                '( delete --no-move ; next --skip-deleted )'.
        Folded the nextmsg and prevmsg commands and functions together into 
                one command which takes arguments.
                Added '--filter <name>' option (eg, for next_personal),
                '--skip-deleted' option, and
                '--last-if-none'/'--first-if-none' options.
                Help updated accordingly.  
                In particular, the 'personal' filter is now used 
                for 'next personal'.  
	        Added --smart-filter and --smart-filter-instance options 
                to the next and prev commands.
        Updated examples/owlconf.erik with the above.
        Made owl_function_fast*filt return a string and not do the 
                narrowing, to make it more general.
        Added a smartfilter command that creates a filter
                based on the current message and returns the name
                of the filter.
        Added M-C-n and M-C-p keybindings to "move to next message 
                matching current" and "move to previous message 
                matching current"
        Added variables edit:maxfillcols and edit:maxwrapcols which 
                will limit how wide editing paragraphs may get before
                they get wrapped.  This is a max and may be narrower
                depending on the current size of the window.
                If 0, the max is unlimited.  Default is 70 columns for
                edit:maxfillcols and unlimited for edit:maxwrapcols.
        Added smartzpunt command with key binding of "C-x k".
                This starts a zpunt command filled in with 
                the proposed zpunt.
        Fixed a memory reference bug in delete and undelete commands.
        Added support for perl to call directly back into owl.
        Changed the implementation of owl::command("...") to immediately
                call back into owl.  This allows perl to get the return
                value of strings returned by owl commands.
        Added the getview command which returns the name of the current 
                view's filter.  
        Added the getvar command which returns the value of a variable.
        Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses TAB to 
                narrow and restore the view.  
        Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses M-c to 
                color messages matching the current one green.
        Integrated change to fix problem with popup blinking on new zephyrs.
        C-l and resizes will now refresh an open viewwin (eg, help).
        Updated doc/code.txt to include info about filters, commands,
                contexts, and keybindings.
        Exec commands cleaned up to not have buffer-size limitations
                and to not mess up spaces.  exec also returns a string
                of the output now.
        Integrated changes from 1.1.3, and added docs for "zlocate -d"
                and new show commands.
        Show with arguments produces help on show.
        Fix a bug in readconfig caught by efence (where we'd try to read before 
                the beginning of a string if it was empty).
        The perl command doesn't do makemsg directly, but instead
             returns the string and it will get printed if it 
             was run interactively.

	      These include regression tests.
	Overhaul/rewrite of variable handling.  Variables are now managed

	      to put information about pings and logins into
	      the sepbar.  (It may be worth also providing a variable
	      which enables this by default, but for now this allows
	      for experimenting with what works well.)
