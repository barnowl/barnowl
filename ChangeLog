	owl.c: don't call use_default_colors if we don't have it
	readconfig.c: added *commented out* code to try to find a
	  system-default owlconf if the user doesn't have one.  Have to
	  ponder if I want this
	zcrypt.c: don't prototype des_ecb_encrypt if there is a prototype in

	     match on this direction
	Outbound messages are no longer type 'admin' but are of the
	     appropriate message type (i.e. 'zephyr') and are direction

	Fixed stristr, which was completely broken
	renamed owl_fmtext_ztext_stylestrip to owl_function_ztext_styletsrip
	     and put it in functions.c
	Attempts to stay near the current message when switching views.
	     When switching from an empty view to one we've previously
	     been in, the new current message position will attempt
	     to be close to the current position from the last 
	     time we visited that view.
	Fixed bug in readconfig.c that prevented building under perl 5.005.
	Switched "C-x C-x" to only "startcommand quit"
	'getsubs' prints closer to the order you sub in.
	Modified the behavior of last so that "> >" will clear the screen.
	The new behavior of last is:
	      Moves the pointer to the last message in the view.
	      If we are already at the last message in the view,
	      blanks the screen and moves just past the end of the view
	      so that new messages will appear starting at the top
	      of the screen.
	Fixed a typo in the help for smartzpunt.
	Fixed functions to handle curmsg being past the end of the view.

1.2.1
        New framework for command handling.
        New framework for keymap handling.
        Added commands for everything that is bound 
             to a key (do 'show commands' to get the full list).
        Added 'multi' and '(' commands to allow multiple commands
             to be specified on a line.              
        Added user keybindings with bindkey command.
        Added command aliases (eg, "alias foo bar").
        Added undelete command that parallels the delete command.
        Added additional options to delete command.
        The reply command now takes arguments.
        Added 'edit:insert-text' command.
        Added 'show zpunts' to show active punt filters.
        Added 'show variable <name>' and 'show variables'.
        Added 'show command <name>' and 'show commands'.
        Added 'show keymap <name>' and 'show keymaps'.
        Added 'M-u' to undelete all messages in current view.
        Fixed dotsend so that the zephyr will still send if there
             is whitespace after the dot but not on the same line.
             This should resolve an issue where dotsend wouldn't work
             if you'd gone up and edited a zephyr.
	Bug in page down fixed
	C-t will transpose characters
        Fix the scrolling bug where we would sometimes fail to scroll
             the screen down, leaving the current message off 
             the bottom of the screen.
        Refixed 'login or login' typo in help
        Fixed M-u description
        Removed 'first' and 'last' from basic command help
        Added M-N to basic key help
        Added M-D, M-u to basic key help
        Fixed a quoting problem in configure.in
        Changed top of help to use 'show' instead of M-x
        Fixed a bug in the summary field for user-created aliases
        Added "reply zaway" which sends a zaway response to the current msg.
        Added "edit:delete-prev-word" command and bound M-BACKSPACE to it.
	Some buffer overruns fixed
        Variables now have a summary and a long description.
                Only the summary is shown with help.
                The long description is shown with "show variable foo".
        Added a 'scrollmode' variable which determines how the screen
             will scroll as the cursor moves.  The default behaves
             identically to previous versions of owl.
             The following modes are supported:
             normal      - This is the owl default.  Scrolling happens
                           when it needs to, and an attempt is made to
                           keep the current message roughly near
                           the middle of the screen.  (default)
             top         - The current message will always be the
                           the top message displayed.
             neartop     - The current message will be one down
                           from the top message displayed,
                           where possible.
             center      - An attempt is made to keep the current
                           message near the center of the screen.
             paged       - The top message displayed only changes
                           when user moves the cursor to the top
                           or bottom of the screen.  When it moves,
                           the screen will be paged up or down and
                           the cursor will be near the top or
                           the bottom.
             pagedcenter - The top message displayed only changes
                           when user moves the cursor to the top
                           or bottom of the screen.  When it moves,
                           the screen will be paged up or down and
                           the cursor will be near the center.
        Added owl_sprintf which returns the formatted string, or NULL.
                The caller must free this string.
                This will allocate enough memory and thus 
                avoid potential some buffer overrun situations.
        Simple implementation of 'zwrite -m' (doesn't yet log an outgoing
                message as having been sent.)
        The "Not logged in or subscribing to messages" error 
                now includes the name of the recipient.
        The "disable-ctrl-d" variable may also be set to "middle"
                which will result in ctrl-d only sending at the 
                end of the message.  This is now the default.
                This also added a command "editmulti:done-or-delete".
        Fixed a bug in the "reply -e" command.
        Always clear the command buffer before executing the command.
                (So that interactive commands can sanely do start-command.)
        Fixed preservation of e->dotsend across owl_editwin_clear().
        Added history for multiline edit windows (eg, for zephyr composition).
                The M-n and M-p keys will cycle through the history ring.
                In particular, it is now possible to edit the command line
                of a zephyr being composed:  C-c it and restart it 
                and then M-p to get the aborted composition back.
        Added owl::send_zwrite(command, message) to the perl glue
                to allow for the direct sending of multi-line messages.
                For example:  owl::send_zwrite("-c foo -i bar", "hello"); 
        Changed owl_fmtext_print_plain to return an alloc'd string to 
                avoid buffer overrun risks.
        Added owl::ztext_stylestrip("...") function to perlglue 
                 which returns the ztext with formatting stripped out.
        Added colorztext variable which can be used to disable @color()
                 strings arriving in messages after it is set.
                 (Currently, changing its value won't reformat messages).
        Outgoing zephyr logging now obeys the logpath variable.
        The '~' character in logpath and classlogpath now gets
                 replaced with the user's home directory.
        Added simple implementation of smartnarrow-to-admin that
                 creates a "type-admin" autofilter.
                 This was done mostly so that M-C-n and M-C-p do something
                 sane on admin messages.
        Added opera to the allowed options to the webbrowser variable.
        Fixed some buffer overruns in the "reply" command.
        When repying to "all" on a message that begins with "CC:" (eg, sent 
                 with "zwrite -C", the reply line will be constructed
                 from the sender and the usernames on the CC: line
                 of the message being replied to.
        There is no such thing as C-R, so left C-r as it is but added:
                 M-r --- edit reply to all
                 M-R --- edit reply to sender
        Added RCS Id strings to all files.
        'show keymaps' shows details of all keymaps after summary list.
        Added --no-move option to delete command.
                In particular, delete-and-always-move-down may now
                be implemented with 
                '( delete --no-move ; next --skip-deleted )'.
        Folded the nextmsg and prevmsg commands and functions together into 
                one command which takes arguments.
                Added '--filter <name>' option (eg, for next_personal),
                '--skip-deleted' option, and
                '--last-if-none'/'--first-if-none' options.
                Help updated accordingly.  
                In particular, the 'personal' filter is now used 
                for 'next personal'.  
	        Added --smart-filter and --smart-filter-instance options 
                to the next and prev commands.
        Updated examples/owlconf.erik with the above.
        Made owl_function_fast*filt return a string and not do the 
                narrowing, to make it more general.
        Added a smartfilter command that creates a filter
                based on the current message and returns the name
                of the filter.
        Added M-C-n and M-C-p keybindings to "move to next message 
                matching current" and "move to previous message 
                matching current"
        Added variables edit:maxfillcols and edit:maxwrapcols which 
                will limit how wide editing paragraphs may get before
                they get wrapped.  This is a max and may be narrower
                depending on the current size of the window.
                If 0, the max is unlimited.  Default is 70 columns for
                edit:maxfillcols and unlimited for edit:maxwrapcols.
        Added smartzpunt command with key binding of "C-x k".
                This starts a zpunt command filled in with 
                the proposed zpunt.
        Fixed a memory reference bug in delete and undelete commands.
        Added support for perl to call directly back into owl.
        Changed the implementation of owl::command("...") to immediately
                call back into owl.  This allows perl to get the return
                value of strings returned by owl commands.
        Added the getview command which returns the name of the current 
                view's filter.  
        Added the getvar command which returns the value of a variable.
        Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses TAB to 
                narrow and restore the view.  
        Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses M-c to 
                color messages matching the current one green.
        Integrated change to fix problem with popup blinking on new zephyrs.
        C-l and resizes will now refresh an open viewwin (eg, help).
        Updated doc/code.txt to include info about filters, commands,
                contexts, and keybindings.
        Exec commands cleaned up to not have buffer-size limitations
                and to not mess up spaces.  exec also returns a string
                of the output now.
        Integrated changes from 1.1.3, and added docs for "zlocate -d"
                and new show commands.
        Show with arguments produces help on show.
        Fix a bug in readconfig caught by efence (where we'd try to read before 
                the beginning of a string if it was empty).
        The perl command doesn't do makemsg directly, but instead
             returns the string and it will get printed if it 
             was run interactively.

	      a string not ending in a newline

	      These include regression tests.
	Overhaul/rewrite of variable handling.  Variables are now managed
	      in an owl_vardict (in g.vars) which contains a dictionary
	      of owl_variable's.  Each owl_variable has dispatch functions
	      for validating values, setting it and getting it,
	      and for setting it to and from string values.
	      The variable.c file contains the list of variables.
	      Stubs for the owl_global_<varname>_get functions and friends
	      are generated from variable.c by stubgen.pl.
	      The help.c messages for variables now calls into variable.c

	Added configfile section to doc/intro.txt (from example config file)

	      be appended to the sepbar.  This allows the configfile
	      to put information about pings and logins into
	      the sepbar.  (It may be worth also providing a variable
	      which enables this by default, but for now this allows
	      for experimenting with what works well.)
	Added doc/code.txt which gives a brief overview of the code.
	Added tags makefile rule and added TAGS to distclean rule.
